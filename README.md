# Repo for "Conditions for aeolian transport in the Solar System"
This directory has the code and data sheets to reproduce this paper https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/1872/

The .pkl files are saves of data that takes some time to compute, so once they are computed once (already done for you) they can just be loaded.
Cells in the juypter notebooks to produce the .pkl files are commented out but you could run them fresh if you like.
